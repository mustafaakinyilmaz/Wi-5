This document is prepared to explain how to use these python scripts.

# Before running

	Before running gui.py, it is necessary to edit paths of required files on your local. There is no need to edit remote paths as they are supposed to be.
	Also change username and password of the AP if necessary.

# While runnig 

	When running gui.py, it is needed to edit some entries showed on the interface.
        First, you have to write down your AP's current IP on the required area.
	As can be seen on the interface, for ControlPlane IP 192.168.6.x as default and for DataPlane IP 192.168.5.x as default are written.
	It is for convenience but you can feel free to change them. 
	After finising filling required areas for your configuration, Go button is pressed.
	Some functions are executed when pressed the Go button. These functions are responsible to carry out creating configuration files on your local, copying them into different paths in your AP.
 	Finally, network configuration is restarted in the AP and bash scripts are made executable.
